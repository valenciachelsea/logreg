## Background
I was interested in analyzing a marketing specific dataset to evaluate predictive models. The dataset is related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The goal is to classify if an individual will subscribe to a term deposit. 

A predictive model will be helpful for understanding prospect conversion and/or building a foundation for a multi-touch attribution model. 

## Technique
The following models were used to train the dataset on and predict the response: logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and xgboost. 

## Data Overview
The dataset was provided by UIC Machine Learning repository.
